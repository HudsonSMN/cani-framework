A non-invasive, treatment-agnostic neuroprosthetic platform that restores bioelectric signaling integrity in children with SMA. Built on **cuneiform voltage logic**, **ultrasound feedback**, and **celestial resonance**, CANI is designed to integrate with gene therapies (Spinraza, Zolgensma, Evrysdi) and support clinicians worldwide.

🔧 Developed by **Hudson Casson** | Based in Purkersdorf, Austria  
📅 28-month co-creative development with Qwen, Deepseek, Claude  
🌍 Open-source under **CERN Open Hardware License v2**

## 🔍 Overview

The **CANI Shepherd Dog Healing System** is not just a stimulator — it is a **living framework** where:
- Biology speaks in frequency
- Ultrasound reveals hidden motion
- Music becomes medical notation
- Ancient wisdom guides modern healing

It operates on three principles:

### ✅ Scientific Precision  
All parameters grounded in DNA-encoded biophysics:
- Resting potential (-70 mV), conduction velocity, ATP synthase rhythm
- IEC 60601-2-10, ISO 14971, EN 62304 compliance
- Real-time EMG/IMU/SpO₂ feedback

### 📐 Mathematical Depth  
Base-60 (sexagesimal) logic from Babylonian astronomy:
- Wedge Rail timing (𒌋 = 1/60 L → +0.8 Hz)
- Celestial Clef synchronization (Earth rotation, Zeta Ophiuchi)
- Triple validation via astrophysical, geodynamic, hydrodynamic models

### 🌀 Cultural Resonance  
Meaning-making through sacred symbols:
- Cuneiform Mode: MU → KUR → GIR → SHU mythic arc
- Maasai vowels, Orca infrasound, Sumerian tones
- Ritual pacing, animated glyphs, haptic storytelling

✅ **One system. Three languages. Same truth.**

## 🧩 Core Components

| Component | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **BNS OS** | Babylonian Neural Stimulator Operating System – symbolic state machine using cuneiform as neural syntax |
| **Spiral Syntax Engine (SSE)** | Adaptive algorithm (MUSA Optimization) adjusting stimulation based on EMG/IMU feedback |
| **Earth Pulse Score** | 8-beat planetary rhythm protocol synchronized with Earth’s rotation and stellar transits |
| **Wedge Rail** | Sexagesimal timing rail mapping 𒌋 to 𒁹 to bioelectric events (NMJ priming → full breath drive) |
| **Triple Validation** | Cross-checks signals using astrophysical, geodynamic, and hydrodynamic reference systems |

## 🎯 Clinical Purpose

Designed to enhance functional outcomes in pediatric SMA patients, especially post-gene therapy (Zolgensma, Spinraza).

### Key Benefits
- Supports motor unit recruitment before visible movement
- Reduces caregiver burden (2,947 hrs/year) via home-based use
- Integrates with existing ultrasound systems (Mindray, Philips, GE)
- Treatment-agnostic: complements all current standards of care
